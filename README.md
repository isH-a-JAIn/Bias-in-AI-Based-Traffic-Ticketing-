Bias in AI-Based Traffic Ticketing: Analyzing Disproportionate Impacts on Racial Groups and Demographic Disparities
Project Overview

This project investigates potential biases in AI-driven traffic ticketing systems, focusing on racial and demographic disparities. Using data from the Stanford Open Policing Project, the paper explores fairness metrics like disparate impact and demographic parity, applying methods like adversarial debiasing to reduce observed biases.

Data Source

Traffic stop data used in this project is publicly available at the Stanford Open Policing Project.
